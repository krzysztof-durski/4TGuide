## Project description

4TGuide is a city trip planning tool that creates plan for a trip based on user preferences, location and local time. It applies changes in real time to the generated trip accordingly to changing conditions.

## Who is it for?

4TGuide is a tool designed for tourists who want to stick to a set plan, but at the same time want the freedom to deviate from it and take other, unplanned actions during their trip.

With 4TGuide you can explore the city your way and always have some suggestions on what to do next without spending 30 minutes on research just to find out that the place you want to go is closing in 15 minutes.
